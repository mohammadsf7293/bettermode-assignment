# Simple Twitter (X) Server Application

## Description

This project is a simplified server application inspired by Twitter (X), focusing on implementing a **permission system** for tweets. It aims to replicate the permission functionalities of Twitter, where the author can control who can view or edit their tweets.  

### Permission System Overview
- **Default Behavior**:  
  - A tweet inherits the parent tweet's permissions.  
  - If a tweet has no parent, it is accessible to everyone, and only the author can edit it.

- **Permissions**:
  - **View**:  
    - The author can add users or groups to the "View" permission list.  
    - Only listed users or group members can see the tweet. Others cannot.  
    - *Auto-Inheritance*: If enabled for a reply tweet, it will inherit the parent tweet's view permissions. Changes to the parent's permissions will reflect on this tweet.  
  - **Edit**:  
    - The author can add users or groups to the "Edit" permission list.  
    - Only listed users or group members can edit the tweet. Others cannot.  
    - *Auto-Inheritance*: Similar to "View" permissions, edit permissions can also inherit from the parent tweet.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Overview

</p>

The system leverages **Redis** as a cache mediator to minimize traffic to MySQL servers. If a requested item is not found in the cache, it is fetched from MySQL and subsequently cached.

## Cache Design

</p>

### Redis Cache
- **Structure**:
  - Each tweet is serialized using **protobuf** and stored in Redis with a key: `tweet:proto:$tweetID`.
  - A **TTL (Time-To-Live)** is assigned to cached tweets to ensure only relevant data is stored.
  - Cache updates occur during tweet creation or modification.  

- **Cache Miss Handling**:  
  If a tweet is not found in Redis, it is retrieved from MySQL and cached again.

- **Cache Refresh Policy**:  
  When a tweet is viewed, its TTL is extended to improve access speed for a period after the view.

## Feed Creation

### Steps to Build a Feed
1. **Retrieve Public Tweet IDs**:  
   Fetch public tweets the user can see (paginated).  
2. **Retrieve Private Tweet IDs**:  
   Fetch private tweets the user is permitted to access.  
3. **Merge and Sort**:  
   Combine public and private tweets, sorted by timestamp.  
4. **Apply Filters**:  
   Filter tweets based on criteria such as hashtags or categories.  
5. **Paginate the Feed**:  
   Prepare the feed and deliver it to the user.

### Optimized Approach
Instead of querying MySQL for every user feed request:
1. Use **Redis ZSETs (Sorted Sets)** for public tweets:  
   - Example query:  
     ```redis
     ZRANGEBYSCORE tweets:public $min $max WITHSCORES LIMIT $offset $count
     ```
     - `$min` and `$max` define the time range.  
     - `$offset` and `$count` handle pagination.  

2. **Chunking Keys**:  
   Divide public tweet data into chunks for scalability. Examples:  
   - Monthly: `tweets:public:2024_10`  
   - Weekly: `tweets:public:2024_10_1`  
   - Daily: `tweets:public:2024_10_01`

## Private Tweet Handling

- **User Groups**:  
  Redis Sets are used to cache group IDs for each user.  
  - If the cache is empty, the group data is fetched from MySQL and stored in Redis.  
  - For new users, a placeholder key can indicate recent database queries to avoid repeated checks.  

- **Private Tweet Retrieval**:  
  Similar to public tweets, private tweets for groups are stored in **Redis ZSETs**.  
  - Large datasets are chunked into separate keys based on time.  

---

## Final Feed Construction

1. Merge private and public tweet lists based on timestamps.  
2. Fetch the serialized tweet data (protobuf) from Redis for each tweet.  
3. Serve the final feed to the user with minimal MySQL dependency.

---

## Future Improvements

- Implement enhanced chunking strategies for Redis keys.  
- Optimize feed filtering mechanisms based on advanced user preferences.  
- Scale the cache system to support larger datasets and concurrent users.
